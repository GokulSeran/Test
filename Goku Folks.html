			<b>"Folk"</b> music is a music genre that includes traditional folk music and the contemporary genre that evolved from the former during the 20th-century folk revival. Some types of folk music may be called world music. <i>Traditional folk music</i> has been defined in several ways: as music transmitted orally, music with unknown composers, music that is played on traditional instruments, music about cultural or national identity, music that changes between generations <u>(folk process)</u>, music associated with a people's <s>folklore, or music performed by custom over a long period of time</s>. It has been contrasted with commercial and classical styles. The term originated in the 19th century, but folk music extends beyond that.
